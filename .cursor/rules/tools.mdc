# Tools Usage Guide

**Check available tools and use based on task complexity.**

## Tools

**🧠 Sequential Thinking**
- Complex problems, multi-step planning
- When you need to think through approaches

**📚 Context7**
- Documentation, examples, library info
- API docs, framework guides

**💻 Desktop Commander**
- Run commands, create files, execute scripts
- Development setup, testing

**🔍 Web Search**
- Current info, recent updates, real-time data
- Latest releases, trends

## Decision Tree

```
Simple question → Answer directly
Need docs/examples → Context7
Need to run something → Desktop Commander
Need current info → Web Search
Complex analysis → Sequential Thinking first
```
## Common Patterns

**Setup Project**
1. Sequential Thinking (plan)
2. Context7 (docs)
3. Desktop Commander (execute)

**Debug Issue**
1. Sequential Thinking (analyze)
2. Context7 (troubleshooting)
3. Desktop Commander (test)

**Research Topic**
1. Context7 (technical docs)
2. Web Search (current trends)
3. Sequential Thinking (synthesize)

**Quick Implementation**
1. Context7 (examples)
2. Desktop Commander (code)

## Rules

- Don't overthink simple tasks
- Use Context7 before Web Search for tech docs
- Combine tools for complex tasks
- Start specific, expand if needed
